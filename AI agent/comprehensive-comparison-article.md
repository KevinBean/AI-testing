# Architectural Comparison: Single Assistant vs. Multi-Agent Systems for Emergency Response

## Introduction

The deployment of AI in emergency response systems presents organizations with a critical architectural choice: using a single comprehensive AI assistant or implementing a multi-agent system with specialized components. This article presents empirical evidence comparing these approaches across standard and challenging emergency scenarios, offering insights into their relative strengths and appropriate use cases.

## Implementation Approaches

Both systems were implemented using the OpenAI Agents SDK with identical base instructions and output formats to ensure a fair comparison:

### Single Assistant Approach

The single assistant approach uses one agent with comprehensive instructions covering the entire workflow:

```python
single_assistant = Agent(
    name="Emergency Response Assistant",
    instructions="Process emergency incident reports by extracting classification, location details, needs assessment, and processing decisions...",
    output_type=EmergencyResponse,
    model_settings=ModelSettings(temperature=0.5)
)

# Usage
result = await Runner.run(single_assistant, report)
response = result.final_output_as(EmergencyResponse)
```

### Multi-Agent Approach

The multi-agent approach breaks down the task into specialized components:

```python
incident_summarizer = Agent(
    name="Incident Summarizer",
    instructions="Extract location, situation, and people count...",
    output_type=IncidentSummary
)

disaster_classifier = Agent(
    name="Incident Classifier",
    instructions="Classify incident type and assess urgency...",
    output_type=IncidentClassification
)

# Create workflow with handoffs
multi_agent = Agent(
    name="Emergency Response Workflow",
    instructions="Process this incident by working with specialized agents...",
    handoffs=[incident_summarizer, disaster_classifier, needs_assessor, final_coordinator]
)

# Usage - identical to single assistant
result = await Runner.run(multi_agent, report)
response = result.final_output_as(EmergencyResponse)
```

## Test Cases and Results

We tested both systems with ten diverse emergency scenarios, ranging from straightforward incidents to complex, ambiguous cases specifically designed to reveal architectural differences.

### Standard Test Cases

1. **Clear Fire Emergency**: Bushfire threatening homes with elderly residents needing evacuation
2. **Flood Situation**: Road flooding with stranded drivers
3. **Medical Emergency**: Elderly person with chest pain and breathing difficulties
4. **Vague Report**: Ambiguous situation at old mill with limited information
5. **Mixed Emergency**: Storm with downed power lines, fires, flooding, and trapped people

### Advanced Challenge Cases

6. **Ambiguous Multi-Incident**: Multiple issues across an area following a storm
7. **Contradictory Information**: Fire with conflicting reports about severity
8. **Simultaneous Incidents**: Car accident and school gas leak occurring simultaneously
9. **Delayed Onset Emergency**: Chemical spill with potential future contamination
10. **Cascading Hazards**: Earthquake with multiple secondary effects (fire, flooding, power outages)

### Overall Performance Results

| Metric | Single Assistant | Multi-Agent System |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Category Accuracy | 80% | 80% |
| Urgency Accuracy | 60% | 40% |
| Location Accuracy | 80% | 80% |
| People Count Accuracy | 60% | 80% |
| Average Needs Identified | 1.2 | 1.8 |
| Confidence Score | 0.86 | 0.93 |
| Human Review Rate | 40% | 20% |
| Average Processing Time | 5.14s | 4.06s |

### Results by Test Case

#### Standard Cases

For standard cases, both systems performed similarly:

```
Clear Fire Emergency:
  Single: ✓Category, ✓Urgency, ✓Location, ✓People, 1 Need, 0.95 Confidence, No Human Review
  Multi:  ✓Category, ✓Urgency, ✓Location, ✓People, 2 Needs, 0.95 Confidence, No Human Review
  
Flood Situation:
  Single: ✓Category, ✗Urgency (High vs Medium), ✗Location, ✗People, 1 Need, 0.90 Confidence
  Multi:  ✓Category, ✗Urgency (High vs Medium), ✗Location, ✗People, 1 Need, 0.95 Confidence
  
Medical Emergency:
  Single: ✓Category, ✓Urgency, ✓Location, ✓People, 1 Need, 0.95 Confidence, No Human Review
  Multi:  ✓Category, ✓Urgency, ✓Location, ✓People, 1 Need, 0.95 Confidence, No Human Review
```

#### Challenging Cases

The differences became more apparent in complex scenarios:

```
Vague Report:
  Single: ✗Category (Fire vs Other), ✓Urgency, ✓Location, ✗People, 0 Needs, 0.60 Confidence, Yes Human Review
  Multi:  ✗Category (Fire vs Other), ✗Urgency (High vs Medium), ✓Location, ✓People, 0 Needs, 0.85 Confidence, Yes Human Review
  
Mixed Emergency:
  Single: ✓Category, ✗Urgency (Critical vs High), ✓Location, ✓People, 3 Needs, 0.90 Confidence, Yes Human Review
  Multi:  ✓Category, ✗Urgency (Critical vs High), ✓Location, ✓People, 5 Needs, 0.95 Confidence, No Human Review
```

## Key Findings

### 1. Needs Identification

The multi-agent system consistently identified more needs across test cases (1.8 vs 1.2 on average). This was particularly evident in the Mixed Emergency case, where the multi-agent system identified 5 distinct needs compared to 3 from the single assistant.

### 2. People Count Accuracy

The multi-agent system showed better people count extraction accuracy (80% vs 60%), suggesting the specialized Incident Summarizer agent might be more thorough in extracting numerical details.

### 3. Confidence Calibration

The single assistant demonstrated better confidence calibration, with lower confidence scores (0.60) for cases where it made errors, such as the Vague Report. In contrast, the multi-agent system maintained high confidence (0.85) even when making category and urgency errors.

### 4. Human Review Decisions

The single assistant was more conservative, recommending human review in 40% of cases compared to 20% for the multi-agent system. For the Mixed Emergency case, the single assistant correctly recommended human review for a complex scenario, while the multi-agent system did not.

### 5. Processing Time

Contrary to expectations, the multi-agent system was faster on average (4.06s vs 5.14s). This unexpected result was primarily driven by a single outlier in the Vague Report case, where the single assistant took 14.18s.

### 6. Urgency Assessment

The single assistant performed better at urgency assessment (60% accuracy vs 40%), suggesting it might better integrate information across the entire report when making urgency judgments.

## Scenario Spotlight: Mixed Emergency

The Mixed Emergency case exemplifies the key differences between the approaches:

**Report**: "Storm has knocked down power lines on Maple Street. Sparks causing small fires in the grass. Road partially flooded from heavy rain. Elderly couple trapped in car that stalled in rising water."

**Single Assistant Response**:
- ✓ Correctly identified Storm as primary category
- ✗ Assessed as Critical (expected: High)
- ✓ Correctly extracted location and people count
- Identified 3 needs
- Recommended human review (appropriate for complex scenario)
- Processing time: 2.92s

**Multi-Agent Response**:
- ✓ Correctly identified Storm as primary category
- ✗ Assessed as Critical (expected: High)
- ✓ Correctly extracted location and people count
- Identified 5 needs (more comprehensive)
- Did NOT recommend human review (missed opportunity for complex case)
- Processing time: 6.01s

This case highlights how the multi-agent system excels at detailed needs identification but might be overconfident and less cautious about recommending human review.

## Implications for Implementation

### When to Use Single Assistant

- When balanced urgency assessment is critical
- When appropriate caution and human review are priorities
- When confidence calibration is important (lower confidence when uncertain)
- For systems where predictable processing time is needed

### When to Use Multi-Agent System

- When comprehensive needs identification is paramount
- When detailed people count and demographic information is important
- When faster average processing time is desired
- For systems where thoroughness outweighs cautious human review

## Conclusion

The empirical comparison reveals that neither approach is universally superior. Instead, the choice should be guided by specific priorities:

- Single assistants show better urgency assessment, more appropriate human review decisions, and better confidence calibration
- Multi-agent systems excel at detailed information extraction, needs identification, and (surprisingly) processing time

For emergency response systems, the choice ultimately depends on organizational priorities and risk tolerance. If comprehensive needs identification is paramount, a multi-agent system may be preferable. If appropriate caution and human review are priorities, a single assistant approach might be more suitable.

Future work should explore hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both architectures, perhaps using specialized agents for information extraction while maintaining a centralized decision process for urgency assessment and human review decisions.
